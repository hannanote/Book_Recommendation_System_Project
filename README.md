## Book_Recommendation_System_Project

### Project Overview: 

This project aimed to develop a personalized book recommendation system for law school students by analyzing their past borrowing history. As a reference assistant at the law school, I identified a need to help students find relevant books based on their interests and preferences. Although the project was inspired by the needs of law school students, I chose to focus on the fantasy genre for this particular implementation.

The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques, including both item-based and user-based approaches, to predict students' preferences and recommend books that closely match their individual interests. By measuring item similarity using cosine similarity and Pearson correlation, the system was optimized to provide the most accurate recommendations.

The recommendation engine achieved an impressive RMSE of 0.0038, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict user preferences and enhance the book discovery process for students. The system significantly improved the user experience by offering relevant book suggestions, ultimately increasing library engagement and satisfaction among students.



Both item-based filtering and user-based filtering approaches were evaluated using similarity, 
RMSE, and SVD measures. These results showed that the system could accurately recommend 
books based on the selection of one book or one user. The recommender system aimed to provide 
users with personalized book recommendations that matched their interests and preferences.
