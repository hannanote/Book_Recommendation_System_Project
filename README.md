## Book_Recommendation_System_Project

### Project Overview: 

Both item-based filtering and user-based filtering approaches were evaluated using similarity, 
RMSE, and SVD measures. These results showed that the system could accurately recommend 
books based on the selection of one book or one user. The recommender system aimed to provide 
users with personalized book recommendations that matched their interests and preferences.
