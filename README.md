## Book_Recommendation_System_Project

### Project Overview: 

This project aimed to develop a personalized book recommendation system for law school students by analyzing their past borrowing history. As a reference assistant at the law school, I identified a need to help students find relevant books based on their interests and preferences. Although the project was inspired by the needs of law school students, I chose to focus on the fantasy genre for this particular implementation.

The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques, including both item-based and user-based approaches, to predict students' preferences and recommend books that closely match their individual interests. By measuring item similarity using cosine similarity and Pearson correlation, the system was optimized to provide the most accurate recommendations.

The recommendation engine achieved an impressive RMSE of 0.0038, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict user preferences and enhance the book discovery process for students. The system significantly improved the user experience by offering relevant book suggestions, ultimately increasing library engagement and satisfaction among students.

### Objective

+ Provide personalized book recommendations to enhance studentsâ€™ book-finding experience
+ Design a recommendation algorithm with high predictive accuracy
  
### Technical Approach

+ Technologies Used: Python, Collaborative Filtering
+ Methodology:
  + Implemented item-based and user-based filtering techniques
  + Measured book similarities using cosine similarity (4.33) and Pearson similarity (4.24)
  + Adopted cosine similarity for its superior performance in the final model
+ Evaluation Metric: Assessed model performance with RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  
### Results

+ Achieved an RMSE of 0.0038, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting user preferences
+ Successfully delivered tailored book recommendations to students

### Conclusion

Gained insights into designing and optimizing data-driven recommendation systems
Learned to compare and apply similarity metrics effectively in real-world scenarios
Recognized the critical role of algorithms in improving user experience
